The construction of the mosque started under the orders of Vikar-ul-Umra, Iqbal ud Dowla, under the rule of Nizam Mir Mahbub Ali Khan Bahadur. The construction was completed by his elder son Nawab Sultan Ul Mulk Bahadur. This masjid has two other names Masjid Iqbal Ud Daula and Aiwan-E-Begumpet. The design of the mosque is inspired by the Cathedral-Mosque of CÃ³rdoba in Spain. It has Quranic verses engraved on the walls. The most interesting feature is the spires instead of the usual circular domes that give the mosque a church-like appearance.
